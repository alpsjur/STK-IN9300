## Welcome!
This repository contains code written by me for the course STK-IN9300 - Statistical Learning Methods in Data Science.

Feel free to check out the jupyter notebook (or any of the other file formats) to get an idea about some of the methods I've learned about in this course (and to see how I solve coding exercises).

### Content
**Assignment 1 – Summarizing and Visualizing Data**

Assignment about exploring a dataset through summarization, visualization, and simple modeling.

Methods: summary statistics, data visualization (bad vs. good), linear regression, model selection.

**Assignment 2 – Regression and Classification**

Assignment about predictive modeling using regression and classification methods on real datasets.

Methods: linear regression (model selection, ridge, GAM, regression trees), classification (k-NN, GAM, decision trees, bagging, random forest, neural networks).
