## Welcome!
This repository contains code written by me for the course STK-IN9300 - Statistical Learning Methods in Data Science.

Feel free to check out the jupyter notebook (or any of the other file formats) to get an idea about some of the methods I've learned about in this course (and to see how I solve coding exercises).
